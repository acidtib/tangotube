On June 3rd, 2020 tango makers from all over Germany protested in public places for better social and financial security, and government support for professionals.

We joined Berlin tango makers in front of the Federal Chancellery for a performance and reading of demands and wishes!

You can sign the petition until June 21st, 2020 here:
